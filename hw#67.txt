HW67 -- A Knight Goes on Tour
2022-03-01
time spent: 1.0 hrs

Knight Tour Algo:
1. Start in the corner 
2. Move in a horizontal knight path to the next possible location 
3. If the kight has not previously visisted this location, mark that 
   this location has been visited. 
4. If the knight has visited the horizontal location, return to the 
   original space, and move in a vertical knight path
5. If there are no possible locations to move, and all the spaces 
   have been visited, you've completed the task! 
6. If all paths have been traversed and you still haven't visited 
   every square, it isn't possible for this specific board

VIQs:
1. How is Knight’s Tour similar to N-Queens?
   Recursion is used in a similar fashion. 

2. How does Knight’s Tour differ from N-Queens?
   When doing Knight's Tour, we can utilize the concept of escape 
   squares. Escape squares are all the sqaures can a knight on a 
   corner square can move to.

3. Which is harder?
   Knight's Tour is harder, as it is not possible for 4x4
   and 6x6 (to our knowledge). In Knight's Tour, you also have
   cover each square on the board, while in N-Queens, we needed
   to fill an N number of spaces. Finally, we tend to tackle
   harder problems as the year progesses, and since we are covering 
   Knight's Tour after N-Queens, it is safe to assume that it is 
   harder. 

4. Is a “Knight’s Tour” even possible?
   Yes, a 'Knight's Tour' is possible, as was proven with a 5x5
   square.
