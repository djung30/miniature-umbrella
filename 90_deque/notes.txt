DISCO -
- For peek vs. get, ultimately, peek is more useful to us as it can also return null if the deque is empty
- The peek() and remove() methods are not as relevant to us, as they perform the same functions as peekFirst() and removeFirst()
QCC - 
- What is the difference between getFirst() and pollFirst()? Both essentially do the same thing, except that pollFirst() just returns null if the deque is empty.
- Would implementing remove(Object o) be useful?
