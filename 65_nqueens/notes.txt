DISCO:
 * Writing out code and drawing a diagram at the same time helps! 
   It's like tracing but as you code
 * Bad base case = cry
 * Conversing with teams and bouncing back ideas was helpful 

QCC:
 * How do we get more than 1 solutions? 
 * Why do we need solve and solveH? Can't we just use one of them? 
 * If a array has 0 rows and columns, should it print out true?
