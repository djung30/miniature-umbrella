### Our Experience
 
This lab was exceptionally long. It was not very fun to do. There was also a lot of reading, but we believe that a good portion of it wasn't required to do the work. We were confused to see activity 6 missing, but didn't complain because the lab was already long enough. Of course, after receiving activity 6, we were able to fully complete the lab. The finished product is cool, but we are unsure if it was really worth our time. We worked together as a group for all the activities, and took turns driving.
