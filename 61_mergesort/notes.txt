DISCO:
 * Drawing the merge tree diagram is insanely helpful!!
 * (And a PROTIP) It's important make the distinction between 
   merge and sort before you start coding. Otherwise, the two
   become muddled

QCC:
 * There was a random import at the top of our file, that wasn't in the 
   skeleton. How did it get there?! 
   * import java.util.function.ToDoubleBiFunction;
 * Recursion is still confusing to visualize...what is the best way to 
   draw out recursion?
 * Comment: print statements are lifesavers

THINKER FIRMWARE:
1. If given a deck with more than 1 card, split the deck in 2 and hand each
   deck to a Thinker with no cards. Then wait for the Thinkeren you gave the 
   card to, to hand them to you. Take the two piles and apply the merge sort
   algorithm. Hand it back to the Thinker who handed you the inital deck.

2. If given 1 card, hand the card back to the Thinker who gave it to you.
