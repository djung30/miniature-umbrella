DISCO:
we could traverse the tree recursively.
QCC:
is there a simpler way to do this?!
how do we determine which node to insert a node at?

1. a perfect binary tree has 2^h - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^(L-1) nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is ceiling of log base of n
