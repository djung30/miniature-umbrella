<2021>-<10>-<4>

DISCOVERIES
Our goal is to make a method called greet that will intake the string and instead of printing it, 
it will rather return it so that we can print it in the main function

We use a different beginning of the method, specifiying the type of data it is outputting 

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS
