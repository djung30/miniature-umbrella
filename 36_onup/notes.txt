 Appendix D: Debugging
 
 - Three kinds of errors: 
  - Compile-time: incorrect syntax: ex. omitting semicolon
  - Run-time: error while program is running: infinite recursion 
  - Logic: program does wrong thing
  
 - Compile Time Errors:
  - Don't make them in the first place! - incremental dev.
  - LOTS of errors??? - fix them one at a time starting from the top
  - WEIRD compiler messages?? - check given location and code for:
    - parantheses, brackets, class defs, method defs
    - uppercase != lowercase
    - semicolons!
    - "Quotation" marks
    - good var assignments
    - Methods: correct, ordered args, right type
    - value vs. void methods
    - instances: static vs. ________
  - Program DOESNT compile NO MATTER WHAT: 
    - check for multiple copies
    - correct location
    - bisection debugging - delete + check portions of code - with backups
  - Compilier says to do...
    - Don't always trust the compiler - it gives you errors, not always fixes to them
  
 - Run-Time Errors:
  - Hanging programs:
    - add print states before + after the loop
    - StackOverflowError
    - Infinite Loop:
      - print vars + condition values at the end of the loop
    - Infinite Recursion: (StackOverflowError)
      - check for correct base case
      - print params at the beginning of the method. 
    - Flow of Excecution:
      - print indicators at the beginning of each method
      - check args
 - Exceptions: 
  - NullPointerException:
    - tried to access object that was null - need to assign a value
  - ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException:
    - index is negative or greater than arrg.length-1
    - print state index value + length of array
    - work backwards
  - StackOverflowError: 
    - see "inifinite recursion"
  - FileNotFoundException:
    - file not found - track it down or make sure your naming is correct
  - Arithmetic Exception: 
    - incorrect arithmetic: ex division by 0
 - Too many PRINT states???
  - Remove / comment out unnecessary states / combine them
  - good formatting 
  - clean up / reorganize actual code as well

- Logic Errors:
  - Ask yourself:
    - What isn't happening in the program?
    - Is something happening that shouldn't?
    - Unexpected results???
  - Create mental model: OR WITH KTSes!!! - breakdown the program
  - Common errors:
    - int vs. double
    - float problems
    - = vs. == vs. .equals
  - Rewrite + shorten complex equations + return statements (temp vars!!!)
  - Take a break sometimes - stay sane
  - Ask others - explain your problems clearly and make sure that code is easy to read and understand
  - DUCKIES!!! - explain the problem and your program to your duckie to truly maximize understanding
